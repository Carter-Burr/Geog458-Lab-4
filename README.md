# Navigating Seattle: A Fire Station Exploration

Map URL:

The examined geographic area for all of our tiles is Seattle. All of the available zoom levels for these tile sets are 11-12, as this was the only way I could make it big enough and still able to upload to GitHub. This also allowed me to maintain consistency throughout my map.


### Layer 1
![Layer One](/img/LayerOne.png)
This is our base map layer that does not include any thematic elements. I decided to pick this color blue because I think that it represents Seattle really well, as blue is the color of many of the sports teams and is often associated with Seattle

### Layer 2

This layer of our map is just our thematic layer made by the geospatial dataset that I picked. The dataset that I picked is of all of the Fire Stations that are located in the Seattle area. I found this interesting because I always wondered why they decided to pick where to put Fire Stations, and what areas might get more stations than others. The data set comes from:  [Seattle GeoData](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/811aa344a72d44e88383ee0c4f3d25d9_0/explore?location=47.633931%2C-122.321403%2C11.00).

### Layer 3

This is the combination of the base map that I created along with the thematic layer. This combines both of the layers to custom look at the Fire Stations across Seattle with my custom base map.

### Layer 4
![Layer Four](/img/LayerFour.png) 
This is a tile set that embodies the theme of UW. In order to do this, I created it with thematic colors of purple and gold, which are the colors for UW. I thought that this was a good idea for Seattle since the University of Washington is a significant element of the city.
